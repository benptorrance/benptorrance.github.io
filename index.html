                <p>
                    I am a graduate of Bellarmine University that has worked in IT for five years. I have experience
                    working on a team, multitasking and prioritization, as well as completing time sensitive tasks. I 
                    have made projects with the Python, Java, and C# languages and I have knowledge of SQL and HTML.

                    <p>August 2021-Present</p>
                    <p>
                        As a Tier 1 Technology Support Specialist, I work as a part of the Help Desk team at Bellarmine University.
                        Our responsibilities are to maintain the classroom equipment around campus, and give technology support to any student or employee that requires it.
                        In this role, I have handled time sensitive issues, worked with two different ticketing systems (SysAid, and then FreshService), around
                        A specific accomplishment I am proud of, was setting up kiosks around campus that utilized a website for students to sign in and report study hours.
                        Due to the way we had to have the kiosks set up, Windows' inbuilt kiosk mode would not cut it, and I had to research another way to set the machines up the way we needed.
